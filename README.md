# Smart Keypad Access with Attendance Tracking Using LPC2148  

This project is a comprehensive implementation of a secure access control system integrated with an attendance tracking mechanism, built using the LPC2148 microcontroller. It includes hardware simulations (Proteus), source codes, and a detailed project report, all organized within a project folder.

## **System Overview**

### 1. **User Authentication and Door Access**  
   - The system initializes by displaying a welcome message on the LCD, prompting users to enter the password via the keypad.  
   - The LPC2148 microcontroller verifies the entered password against the stored credentials.  
   - Upon a successful match:  
     - The door is opened by rotating the motor in the clockwise direction.  
     - The Seven-Segment Display increments the attendance count by 1.  
   - After a short delay, the door automatically closes with the motor rotating in the anticlockwise direction.  

### 2. **Attendance Tracking**  
   - Every successful password entry updates the attendance count.  
   - The LPC2148 sends a pulse signal to increment the attendance count, which is displayed in real time on the Seven-Segment Display.  
   - The system ensures a seamless combination of access control and attendance management.
